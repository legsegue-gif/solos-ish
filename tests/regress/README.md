# fs/wait syscall regression tests

These pin the observable behaviour of five fixes so a future change that
reintroduces one of them fails here instead of in a user's shell.

| Fix | What broke before it | Covered by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #30 `O_DIRECTORY` flag value | `O_DIRECTORY_` carried the x86 value `1<<16` instead of aarch64's `0x4000`, so the `ENOTDIR` check never fired and `O_DIRECT` (`1<<16` on arm64) was misread as `O_DIRECTORY`. GNU `cp` over an existing file failed with `cannot create regular file '<dst>/<src>': Not a directory`. | `regress_syscall.c`, `regress_cp.sh` |
| #30 `O_NOFOLLOW` | Translated to the host `open()`, but `generic_openat()` resolves the last path component first, so the flag was a no-op and `open(symlink, O_NOFOLLOW)` returned an fd to the target. | `regress_syscall.c` |
| #31 fakefs `stat`/`fstat` | The hook-routed branch of `fakefs_stat()` never set `dev` (nor `nlink`/`blksize`), so `stat()` and `fstat()` disagreed on `st_dev` for one file. GNU `cp` reads that as `skipping file '...', as it was replaced while being copied`. | `regress_syscall.c`, `regress_cp.sh` |
| #29 `waitpid` EINTR | `do_wait()` treated its internal 1s timeout (`_ETIMEDOUT`) as a signal, so any child running longer than a second made its parent's wait fail with `EINTR`. gcc died with `failed to get exit status: Interrupted system call`. | `regress_syscall.c` |
| FMOV (immediate) decode | `gen.c` had two call sites expanding an 8-bit AArch64 FP immediate through `arm64_fpimm_to_bits()`, which expects bit6 already inverted. `gen_simd_fp()` inverted it; the scalar `FMOV Dd/Sd, #imm` path passed the raw imm8, so every scalar FP immediate was mis-scaled 8x (`#0.71875` -> `11.5`). V8's `ieee754::cos` loads its C1/C2 range-reduction constants this way, making `Math.cos(Math.PI/4)` return `15.707106781186546`. | `regress_fmov_imm.{c,S}` |
| `waitid` siginfo | `sys_waitid` returned the raw wait status instead of decoding it: `si_status` was `7936` for `exit(31)` and `si_code` was always 0, so a killed child looked like an exited one. `si_uid` was never set at all. | `regress_syscall.c` |
| POSIX timer `SIGEV_SIGNAL` | `sys_timer_create`'s `SIGEV_SIGNAL` branch left `timer->thread_pid` at 0, and `posix_timer_callback` resolves its target with `pid_get_task(thread_pid)`. Pid 0 is never a live task, so the lookup returned NULL and the callback dropped the signal — both syscalls reported success, the clock expired on time, and nothing was delivered. GNU coreutils `timeout` schedules its deadline this way, so `timeout 3 sleep 300` ran the full 300s and exited 0, which reads from the outside as "processes cannot be killed". busybox's `timeout` was unaffected: it polls with `kill(pid, 0)` from a watchdog grandchild and arms no timer, which is why the same command worked in one rootfs and hung in another. | `regress_syscall.c` |
| JIT gadget-buffer OOM | `gen()` called `abort()` when `realloc()` could not grow the gadget buffer, so one guest process outgrowing memory (a `python3` thread pool backgrounded on a phone) killed the whole app — every other guest thread plus the UI — with SIGABRT in `gen_ldst`/`gen_step`. It also advanced `capacity` before the `realloc`, leaving it describing memory that was never allocated. | `regress_jit_oom.c` |

## Running

```sh
tests/regress/run.sh                          # against alpine-arm64-321 via -r
tests/regress/run.sh -i build/ish -r myrootfs # pick binary / rootfs
tests/regress/run.sh -m -f -r alpine-arm64-fakefs   # fakefs: runs the cp cases
```

`run.sh` cross-compiles `regress_syscall.c` for the guest with
`aarch64-linux-musl-gcc` (override with `$CC_GUEST`). If no cross-compiler is
installed it skips rather than fails, since the toolchain is not vendored here.

Every assertion in `regress_syscall.c` is mount-independent, so `-r` mode is the
one that matters for the syscall cases. `-f` mode exists for the `cp` cases,
which need GNU coreutils — usually only present in the fakefs rootfs. Staging a
static binary into a fakefs means registering it in `meta.db`, which is slow, so
`-f` skips the syscall binary and runs only `regress_cp.sh`.

`regress_cp.sh` needs GNU coreutils `cp`, not busybox `cp`: only GNU `cp` probes
its destination with `open(dst, O_PATH|O_DIRECTORY)` and compares
`(st_dev, st_ino)` across `stat`/`fstat`. Without it the `cp` cases skip.

To exercise #31 against a real fakefs mount point, pass the guest path of a file
under one:

```sh
tests/regress/run.sh -m -f -r alpine-arm64-fakefs -f /var/solos/shared/doc.txt
```

That requires a path-translate hook, which only the iOS app installs, so it is
optional — the `stat`/`fstat` assertions still run against the rootfs without it.

## Verifying the tests actually catch the bugs

Run the built binary against an iSH built from a commit before these fixes; it
should report 16 failures across all five areas:

```sh
aarch64-linux-musl-gcc -static -O0 -o <rootfs>/tmp/regress_syscall \
    tests/regress/regress_syscall.c
<old-ish> -r <rootfs> /tmp/regress_syscall
```

## fs hot path / exit race (2026-09-19)

| Fix | What broke before it | Covered by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| process-wide path cache (e78c6980) | `__thread` cache was empty for every forked process; fork storms spent 85% CPU re-resolving the same paths through SQLite and host fstatat | `regress_path_cache.sh` |
| orphan cleanup on demand (43b7c59b) | every last close ran a SQLite write transaction under `inodes_lock`; rename-over-a-closed-file leaked its `stats` row | `regress_inode_orphan.sh` + host-side orphan count |
| inode ref taken in open() (608530ba) | `generic_openat` held `inodes_lock` across a SQLite read; the naive "fstat outside the lock" reorder reintroduces the d57b6d26 open-vs-unlink race | `regress_open_unlink_race.c` |
| mm unpublished under general_lock in do_exit | `/proc/<pid>/{cmdline,stat,statm,maps,mem}` readers took `mem->lock` on an mm that `do_exit` was destroying without `general_lock`: `mem_destroy` trapped on `pthread_rwlock_destroy`=EBUSY or the reader hit freed memory. Killed iSH in <1s with a fork storm plus `ps`/`/proc` readers | `regress_proc_exit_race.sh` |

All four run from `tests/regress/run_fs_perf.sh -i build-native/ish -r <fakefs rootfs> [-b]`,
which works on a COPY of the rootfs so the meta.db orphan check is reproducible.
