// [T-ish-offload-path-scope] upstream #288 — which exec()s a native offload may
// take over.
//
// Offloads used to match on the BASENAME alone, so any file called `ffmpeg`
// anywhere in the guest — `./ffmpeg`, `/tmp/build/ffmpeg`, a shell wrapper in
// the user's workspace — was silently replaced by the app's in-process FFmpeg.
// The user's own binary never ran and nothing said so.
//
// This header is the policy only, deliberately free of any kernel dependency so
// it can be compiled and tested on its own (see offload_tests/path_scope). The
// one check that needs the filesystem — "is this a #! script?" — stays at the
// exec call site, which already has generic_open.
